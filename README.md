# Setup #
All details specific to the server can be changed in config.ini, it was setup as such so that in the event of the main network's IP changing or projects domain's change. <br>

Main bot code found in **main.py**, commands are inside of the **cogs** directory. Functions such as scraping websites or server pings are in the **api** directory.<br>

This bot was built inside of the replit.com platform, the bot's "Token" is stored inside of private database within replit. Additionally some folders displayed inside of github pertain directly to that platform. Functionality for bot TOKEN's to be configured in config.ini has been added, uncomment the 2nd last line of main.py to enable.<br>

Bot is using the [Disnake](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/stable/) library to connect to the Discord API.

# Config.ini #
Config.ini has 5 sections: DiscordServer for discord server configs, Advert for automated message configs, ServerSettings for game server settings, Website for game related urls, StatusAlerts for admin alerts for when the game goes offline.
